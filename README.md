## Scripting

Scripting is a super powerful tool for text manipulation. This feature is disabled by default, due to the complexity of these filters, as well as the additional resources that they may take up.

While the scope of these scripts are extremely limited, and several measures are put in place to ensure security and stability, these scripts are still very powerful, and you should **never** run code that you don't trust

To learn more about these filters, you can view the [example filters](https://github.com/DarkKronicle/AdvancedChatFilters/tree/main/example_filters) in this repository, or view [the wiki](https://github.com/DarkKronicle/AdvancedChatFilters/wiki)

## Development

To develop all dependencies should automatically be processed through gradle. To ensure code consistency the hook pre-commit.sh can be used. To install the pre-hook run:

`ln -s ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit`

Reference the [example mod](https://github.com/DarkKronicle/AdvancedChatModuleTemplate) for individual use cases.
